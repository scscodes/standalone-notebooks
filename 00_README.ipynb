    "Below is an example of how you could reorganize and split your workflow into three separate notebooks for unsupervised, supervised, and time series modeling, along with a dedicated setup/util file. The setup/util file will handle environment loading, database connections, data loading, and some utility functions. We will also show how to save intermediate data artifacts (e.g., as CSV or pickle files) so that each notebook can read from these intermediate outputs rather than repeating the entire pipeline.\n",

    "### File Structure Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You might structure your files as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "project/\n",
    "00_setup_utils.py            # Setup and utility functions (could also be a notebook)\n",
    "01_unsupervised.ipynb        # Unsupervised modeling (e.g., UMAP, KMeans, DBSCAN)\n",
    "02_supervised.ipynb          # Supervised modeling (e.g., Random Forest)\n",
    "03_time_series.ipynb         # Time series modeling (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet)\n",
    "data/\n",
    "intermediate_unsupervised.csv   # Intermediate data after unsupervised step\n",
    "intermediate_supervised.csv      # Intermediate data after supervised step\n",
    "intermediate_timeseries.csv      # Intermediate data after time-series step\n",

    "### setup_utils.py\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "- Load environment variables\n",
    "- Setup database connections\n",
    "- Provide generic utility functions (plotting, data validation, etc.)\n",
    "- Provide helper functions to load and save intermediate data\n",

    "### 01_unsupervised.ipynb\n",
    "\n",

    "- Connect to the database and load the raw data\n",
    "- Perform data preprocessing\n",
    "- Run UMAP, KMeans, DBSCAN clustering\n",
    "- Save the resulting dataset with cluster labels and outlier flags to an intermediate CSV for subsequent notebooks\n",

    "### 02_supervised.ipynb\n",

    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "- Load the intermediate data from the unsupervised step\n",
    "- Run supervised models (e.g., Random Forest) to predict a target variable from the cluster/outlier features or from other vital signs.\n",
    "- Save results if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 03_time_series.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "- Load the intermediate (unsupervised/supervised) data if needed, or re-query the original.\n",
    "- Apply ARIMA, Prophet, or both to generate forecasts.\n",

    "### Notes on Carrying Over Prerequisite Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Saving Intermediate Outputs:**\n",
    "After completing the unsupervised step in `01_unsupervised.ipynb`, we saved `intermediate_unsupervised.csv`. The supervised notebook `02_supervised.ipynb` directly loads this file using `load_intermediate_data` and proceeds without re-running the entire unsupervised pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flexible Workflow:**\n",
    "Each subsequent notebook can load the results from the previous notebooks. If you need additional processing or more features, simply ensure they are saved in the intermediate files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modular Utilities:**\n",
    "The `00_setup_utils.py` script contains shared functions (loading environment variables, setting up DB connections, plotting functions) and can be reused across notebooks by simply importing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parallelization and Large Computations:**\n",
    "If needed, you can still incorporate multiprocessing or other optimizations in each notebook. The key idea is that each stage reads from previously saved outputs rather than re-running every step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach creates a clear separation of concerns: data loading and preprocessing in one place, unsupervised modeling in another, supervised modeling in another, and time-series forecasting in its own environment. Such modularization makes the pipeline more maintainable, clearer, and quicker to iterate on."
